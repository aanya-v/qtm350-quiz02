## Introduction

What is the relationship between life expectancy and population? Is there a correlation? Is this correlation causation?? In this page we will run some data analyses to find out (not really the causation part though merely a visualization)!

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')
plt.scatter(df['population_millions'], df['life_expectancy'])
plt.xlabel('Population (in millions)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy')
plt.title('Population vs Life Expectancy')
plt.show()



```
